I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\\n&gt;on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this\\n&gt;company.\\n\\n&gt;I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\\n&gt;me some kind of question...\\n\\nYour boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she\\ndoes not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher.\\nSexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an\\nenormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that\\nthey are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not\\ndiscuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel\\ndepartment that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most\\ncompanies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety\\ndoes seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.\\n\\nIt is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is\\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\\nyou.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)\\n\\nYou may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband,\\netc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is\\nsupportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.\\n\\n&gt;So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\n&gt;person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\\n&gt;could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\\n&gt;number was posted.\\n\\nThis happens to a lot of people.  Honest.  I believe it may seem\\nto be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are\\ngoing through.  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while\\nworking than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...)\\nI've had this happen to me a lot, often because they didn't realize\\nmy car was broken, etc.  Then they will come back and wonder why I\\ndidn't want to go (this would tend to make me stop being angry at\\nbeing ignored and make me laugh).  Once, we went off without our\\nboss, who was paying for the lunch :-)\\n\\n&gt;For this\\n&gt;reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.\\n\\nWell, if you can't turn to the computer for support, what would\\nwe do?  (signs of the computer age :-)\\n\\nIn closing, please don't let the hateful actions of a single person\\nharm you.

I\\n&gt;bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably\\n&gt;enough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me to\\n&gt;get some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a\\n&gt;doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the\\n&gt;chemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say\\n&gt;either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil\\n&gt;is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His\\n&gt;father was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate\\n&gt;into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about\\n&gt;their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd\\n&gt;malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from\\n&gt;acne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.\\n\\n&gt;My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort\\n&gt;of teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?

Very little acne as a teenager. I\\ndidn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it\\nreally only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. \\n\\nFrequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp\\nthing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under\\nthe bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day\\nvitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  \\nis used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be\\nwhere the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease \\non my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating\\nmeat).\\n\\nKeeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm\\nwater bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will\\nhelp prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it\\nsoftens and washes off when it has a chance.

I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain.\\nHe suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I\\nneed to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may\\nmonitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.\\n\\nI did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary).\\nI explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request,\\nand that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more\\nfrequent and the medication did not seem effective.\\n\\nThe doctor called me back, and his first words were, \"Whatever you want,\\nyou'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit-\\nchat with you!\"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \\nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\\nhad more time.  He responded, \"Just spit it out now because no time is\\na good time.\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\\nand then said \"well, never mind\" and he said he'll talk to various\\ncolleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.\\n\\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express\\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I\\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\\nme that he just doesn't have time to \"rap with patients\" and thought\\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\\n\"rap\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \\nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\\nthis apology: \"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of\\ntime to deal with that.\"  He then told me to call him the next day\\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\\n\\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\\n\\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\\nnow I am afraid to call him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t--Marlena\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

If he/she\\ndoes not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher.\\nSexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an\\nenormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that\\nthey are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not\\ndiscuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel\\ndepartment that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most\\ncompanies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety\\ndoes seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.\\n\\nIt is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is\\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\\nyou.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)\\n\\nYou may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband,\\netc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is\\nsupportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.\\n\\n>So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\n>person had already left for lunch.

I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain.\\nHe suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I\\nneed to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may\\nmonitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.\\n\\nI did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary).\\nI explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request,\\nand that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more\\nfrequent and the medication did not seem effective.\\n\\nThe doctor called me back, and his first words were, \"Whatever you want,\\nyou'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit-\\nchat with you!\"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \\nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\\nhad more time.  He responded, \"Just spit it out now because no time is\\na good time.\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\\nand then said \"well, never mind\" and he said he'll talk to various\\ncolleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.\\n\\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express\\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I\\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\\nme that he just doesn't have time to \"rap with patients\" and thought\\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\\n\"rap\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \\nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\\nthis apology: \"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of\\ntime to deal with that.\"  He then told me to call him the next day\\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\\n\\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\\n\\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\\nnow I am afraid to call him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t--Marlena\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

    "# What is the causal impact of having a PhD on making over \\$50K?\n",
    "\n",
    "As of v0.27.x, ktrain supports causal inference using [meta-learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03461). We will use the well-stuided [Adults](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amaiya/ktrain/master/ktrain/tests/tabular_data/adults.csv) dataset from the UCI ML repository, which is census data from the early to mid 1990s.  The objective is estimate how much earning a PhD increases the probability of making over $50K.  This dataset is simply being used as a simple demonstration example.  Unlike conventional supervised machine learning, there is typically no ground truth for causal infernence models, unless you're using a simulated datasets.  So, we will simply check our estimates to see if they agree with intuition for illustration purposes.\n",

    "Let's begin by loading the dataset and creating a binary treatment (1 for PhD and 0 for no PhD)."

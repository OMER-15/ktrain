    "# What is the causal impact of having a PhD on making over 50K/year?\n",
    "\n",
    "As of v0.27.x, ktrain supports causal inference using [meta-learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03461). We will use the well-studied [Adults](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amaiya/ktrain/master/ktrain/tests/tabular_data/adults.csv) dataset from the UCI ML repository, which is census data from the early to mid 1990s.  The objective is estimate how much earning a PhD increases the probability of making over $50K in salary.  This dataset is simply being used as a simple demonstration example.  Unlike conventional supervised machine learning, there is typically no ground truth for causal infernence models, unless you're using a simulated datasets.  So, we will simply check our estimates to see if they agree with intuition for illustration purposes.\n",

    "Let's begin by loading the dataset and creating a binary treatment (1 for PhD and 0 for no PhD)."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, there is no ground truth for this problem to validate our estimates.  In the cells above, we simply inspected the estimates to see if they correspond to our intuition on what should happen.  Another approach to validating causal estimates is to evaluate robustness to various data manipulations (i.e., sensitivity analysis). For instance, the Placebo Treatment test replaces the treatment with a random covariate.  We see below that this causes our estimate to drop to near zero, which is expected and exactly what we want. Such tests might be used to compare different models."
